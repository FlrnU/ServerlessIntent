Imagine a world where developers focus solely on crafting code, free from the shackles of server management.This is the promise of serverless computing, a paradigm shift that’s revolutionizing software development. Serverless computing offers automatic scaling, adjusting to demand without manual intervention. You pay only for what you use, optimizing costs. This approach enhances productivity by reducing infrastructure management tasks, allowing developers to focus on innovation. While serverless offers many benefits, it’s essential to understand potential challenges. Vendor lock-in can limit flexibility, and latency issues may arise in specific use cases. Additionally, there are limitations in execution time and resource allocation.
